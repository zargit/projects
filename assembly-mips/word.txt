There was once a wise wizard called Wilbert. One day Wilbert found a wild wolf that was wounded. Wilbert waved his magic wand and soon the wolf was well. Then Wilbert looked at his watch and went home. On the way, Wilbert saw a spiderâ€™s web, some worm and a woodpecker. When Wilbert got home he saw the wolf through his window. The wolf winked at Wilbert and went on his way.
